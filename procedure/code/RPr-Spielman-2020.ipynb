    "> Spielman, S. E., Tuccillo, J., Folch, D. C., Schweikert, A., Davies, R., Wood, N., & Tate, E. (2020). Evaluating Social Vulnerability Indicators: Criteria and their Application to the Social Vulnerability Index. Natural Hazards, 100(1), 417–436. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-019-03820-z\n",

    "The Spielman et al (2020) paper is in turn a replication of:\n",

    "\n",
    "Spielman et al (2020) developed methods to evaluate the internal consistency and construct validity of the Cutter, Boruff and Shirley (2003) Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI).\n",
    "First, they reproduce a national SoVI model and validate it against an SPSS procedure provided by the original research group (Hazards Vulnerability Research Institute at University of South Carolina).\n",
    "The original SoVI uses 42 independent z-score normalized variables from the U.S. Census, reduces the data to factors using Principal Components Analysis, selects the first eleven factors, inverts factors with inverse relationships to social vulnerability, and sums the factors together to produce a SoVI score.\n",
    "The reproduced SoVI model was slightly different than the original model due to changes in U.S. Census data, using only 28 variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spielman et al. modify the geographic extent of the SoVI calculation by calculating SoVI on a national extent, and then recalculating for each of ten Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) regions, and again for a single state or cluster of states within each of the ten regions, resulting in 21 total indices.\n",
    "Internal consistency is assessed by calculating the spearman rank correlation coefficient of the SoVI score for counties in the state model compared to the FEMA region model and national model.\n",
    "Construct validity is assessed by summing the loadings for each input variable across the PCA factors in each model and calculating the variables sign (positive/negative) and the rank of the variable's total loading compared to the other variables.\n",
    "These signs and ranks are summarized across all 21 versions of the SoVI model with regard to the number of times the sign is different from the national model and the distributions of ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reproduction study, we attempt to reproduce identical SoVI model outputs by comparing to the outputs in the original GitHub repository and the tables and figures in Spielman et al's paper.\n",
    "We succeed in reproducing output data files, but find slight discrepencies in our figures and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Social vulnerability, social indicators, Principal Component Analysis, reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "## Study design\n",
    "\n",
    "We computationally reproduce Spielman et al's original work using the code provided in their Github repository (https://github.com/geoss/sovi-validity), adapting their code to work in an updated Python environment using current package versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original paper was a replication study testing the sensitivity of SoVI to changes in geographic extent.\n",
    "Spielman et al addressed the following hypotheses in their work:\n",
    "\n",
    "> OR-H1: SoVI is internally inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this hypothesis, Spielman et al illustrated that SoVI is not robust to changes in geographic extent by calculating SoVI scores for ten selected states or groups of states on three geographic extents: national, FEMA region, and state(s).\n",
    "The counties within the state(s) of interest were then selected and ranked according to their SoVI score.\n",
    "OR-H1 was tested by calculating Spearman's rank correlation between the state and FEMA region models and between the state and national models.\n",
    "\n",
    "> OR-H2: SoVI is theoretically inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this hypothesis, Spielman et al used the same SoVI models as described under OR-H1.\n",
    "For each model, they summed all of the PCA factors together to determine the net influence of each variable in each model.\n",
    "Then they recorded the signs of each variable and calculated the number of deviations of the ten state and FEMA region models from the national model.\n",
    "They also ranked the variables by absolute value for each model and calculated summary statistics regarding the distribution of ranks for each variable amongst all models.\n",
    "Spielman et al did not use a particular statistical method to test OR-H2, but illustrated substantial disagreements between variable rankings and signs amongst the 21 SoVI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our reproduction, we address the following research questions:\n",
    "> RPr-Q1: To what extent is Spielman et al's paper reproducible?\n",
    "\n",
    "> RPr-Q2: How can we enhance the paper's reproducibility?\n",
    "\n",
    "We answer these questions by working through Spielman et al's code line by line, attempting to reproduce their results in an updated coding environment and making edits or notes regarding reproducibility as we see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer: we worked with the data and code before writing this report, so there is no pre-registration of the analysis plan.\n",
    "We originally intended to publish only a replication of this study; we did not anticipate publishing a reproduction until we spent some time working with the code.\n",

    "We anticipate collaborators working on the project from different computers and different operating systems, and we seek to containerize the project so that scripts can be run on many different machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original study used Python for their analysis, so we reproduce their results in Python, using a containerized conda environment.\n",

This was unnecessary because we only needed to impute data for one county and that county had spatial lag data. Also note that Spielman et al's method for imputing data for MHSEVAL_ALT is a deviation from Cutter's original methodology, in which she imputed a 0 for any missing value. While this is a deviation from the original SoVI methodology, 0 is an unrealistic median home value, so Spielman et al's method for imputation seems like a reasonable improvement."

    "We made a different choice than Spielman et al in this table. Since we adjusted all variables such that larger values are theoretically associated with a higher degree of vulnerability before calculating SoVI, we would expect all outputs to be positive. In Spielman et al's \"expected contribution\" column, some signs were negative -- they recorded the directionality we would expect of the variables if they had made no adjustments before calculating SoVI. This leads to a misleading table because their \"original contribution\" column displays the signs of the model output including prior adjustments to directionaity, but the \"expected contribution\" column displays the signs if the model had not adjusted directionality. To make their \"expected contribution\" column consistent with their \"original contribution\" column, they would need all of the signs to be positive in the \"expected contribution\" column. We choose to simply not include an \"expected contribution\" column since there would be no variation within it anyway. Additionally, we add a negative sign in front of any variables that we changed the directionality of for the sake of clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Spielman et al's figure, QNOAUTO_ALT has 1 reversal instead of 0 and QEXTRCT_ALT has 7 reversals instead of 6. These are pretty minor differences. As illustrated in the results section, our variable_contributions dataset matches Spielman et al's data perfectly, so our best guess is that the differences are due to transciption errors when they constructed their figure."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this study was to computationally reproduce Spielman et al's \"Evaluating social vulnerability indicators: criteria and their application to the Social Vulnerability Index\" (Spielman et al, 2020). \n",
    "To their credit, Spielman et al provided their code, data, and metadata in their [sovi-validity GitHub repository](https://github.com/geoss/sovi-validity), making their analysis transparent, accessible, and reproducible in a manner that is rare in the field of geography.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all the necessary data and code in one GitHub repository, we did not anticipate conducting a reproduction study. \n",
    "We assumed that we would be able to run their work relatively easily before continuing on to a replication study. \n",
    "However, even with all of the resources they provided, we still spent a month of full-time work on this project before successfully reproducing their results. \n",
    "Our experiences working with this data motivated us to publish this report, so that we can share the obstacles that made the reproduction process so time-intensive and point out methods that researchers can employ to enhance the reproducibility of their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main obstacles that stood in the way of reproducing Spielman et al's results were:\n",
    "1. Outdated packages\n",
    "2. Extraneous data and code\n",
    "3. A confusing file system\n",
    "4. Missing code\n",
    "5. Our own edits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outdated packages\n",
    "\n",
    "The first obstacle, and one that we anticipated because much of Spielman et al's code was written 6 or 7 years ago, was the presence of outdated packages. \n",
    "When working with code developed on outdated packages, one has the option of adjusting their package versions or adapting your code to run on current package versions. \n",
    "We opted for the latter because we found no documentation regarding the package versions used by Spielman et al, and we hope to use our code in the future for a replication study, preferably operating on an up-to-date software environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "One notable package issue occurred because Spielman et al wrote their code before the [refactoring of PySAL](https://github.com/pysal/pysal/wiki/PEP-13:-Refactor-PySAL-Using-Submodules) into several submodules that occured with the release of [PySAL 2.0.0](https://pypi.org/project/pysal/2.0.0/) in 2019.\n",
    "In Spielman et al's work, functions for calculating contiguity-based spatial weights were included in the PySAL package, but after the refactoring, this feature is included in the libpysal package.\n",
    "Without prior familiarity with the intricacies of PySAL's updates over the years, it took us some time to locate equivalent functions in the updated package.\n",
    "Changes to PySAL were perhaps the most time-consuming package update issue, but there were other smaller issues along the way, such as [Pandas's deprecation of the `.ix` indexer](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20/whatsnew.html) in favor of `.iloc` and `.loc`.\n",
    "Most edits due to package updates were small, but they all took some time to figure out, time that adds up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers can eliminate this obstacle to reproducibility by containerizing their work.\n",
    "For this study in particular, we found that providing a list of required packages and their versions in a text file was sufficient to reconstruct the environment on another machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extraneous data and code\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue that required a substantial amount of effort to overcome was the presence of extraneous data and code.\n",
    "For example, although Spielman et al's paper only mentions 5-year ACS data from 2012, in their `data_prep.py` file, they also import and manipulate decennial census variables.\n",
    "Unfortunately, they do not comment their code well-enough for other researchers to understand why they do this without combing through every line of code.\n",
    "After some close inspection, we found that all of the decennial variables except for land area are not used to generate their results, allowing us to discard unused data and a substantial amount of code.\n",
    "In their `data_prep.py` code, Spielman et al also include some analysis of standard errors that we eventually discovered to be unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several other files in Spielman et al's code folder also include extraneous code. \n",
    "In particular, the entire contents of the `drop1_place.py`, `spearman.py`, and `visualization.py`, as well as portions of `compute_sovis.py` implementing a drop1 analysis turned out to be unnecessary to generate the results they describe in their paper.\n",
    "It seems that Spielman et al were considering several possible directions of research, and they left their dead ends in their code.\n",
    "We omit all of the unnecessary steps in our report, reducing the computational intensity of the analysis and making our work easier to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the presence of unnecessary code may not have bothered the original authors of the paper, in the absence of comments explaining their purpose, extra code makes it far more difficult for an independent party to understand their work.\n",
    "If one does not quickly realize which parts of the code are actually necessary, they may spend time debugging code just to discard it later on, as we did.\n",
    "Researchers can make it much easier for others to reproduce their work by publishing a clean version of their code with informative comments and no extraneous work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confusing file system\n",
    "\n",
    "From our experience working with Spielman et al's repository, we find that an index or some metadata regarding the structure of code and data would be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for Spielman et al's analysis was originally divided into 6 different python scripts:\n",
    "- `data_prep.py`\n",
    "- `spss_pca.py`\n",
    "- `drop1_place.py`\n",
    "- `compute_sovis.py`\n",
    "- `spearman.py`\n",
    "- `visualization.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "While one could infer the order of the scripts from the file names, file contents, and whether a file called any other files, that process took a fair amount of work and left room for error.\n",
    "When one script calls another script which calls another script, it can become difficult to locate the source of an error.\n",
    "Had the researchers provided an index explaining the purpose of each script and how they work together, like our `procedure_metadata.csv`, that would have reduced the confusion of working with multiple scripts and prevented us from even attempting to debug unnecessary scripts.\n",
    "Similarly, had the authors provided a quick summary of each of their data files, like our `data_metadata.csv`, then we would have quickly understood the purpose of each data source, instead of guessing at each's purpose based on its name and the code that manipulates it.\n",
    "Generally, the more information a researcher can provide about their data and code upfront, the less time other researchers will need to spend deciphering their files during a reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing code\n",
    "\n",
    "While Spielman et al provide all of the code required to reproduce their data files, they do not provide any code for reproducing their figures.\n",
    "By providing their code, data, and metadata in a GitHub repository, they are on the leading edge of reproducibility in geography.\n",
    "However, they could further improve reproducibility by including code to generate their figures.\n",
    "As noted in the results section, the output data files produced by our analysis and provided by Spielman et al were identical, yet our figures exhibited slight differences.\n",
    "Had Spielman et al provided code to produce their figures, it would be absolutely clear whether the differences between our figures were due to typos or a difference in code; and if the differences were typos, then producing their figures with code working directly from their data may have eliminated that issue altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our own edits\n",
    "\n",
    "The other major time sink occurred because of our own edits.\n",
    "Spielman et al provided data and metadata for reproducing their results; assuming that they acquired their data appropriately, this should be sufficient for a reproduction.\n",
    "However, our end-goal with this project is to produce a replication study that will potentially involve census data from multiple years.\n",
    "To facilitate the acquisition of analogous data in several different time periods, it is helpful to automate the process rather than manually downloading a large number of files.\n",
    "For this reason, we used the python package, [pygris](https://walker-data.com/pygris/), to acquire our data directly from the census via an API.\n",
    "Learning to use pygris and checking that our data sufficiently matches Spielman et al's data was a lengthy but worthy process, as it improves reproducibility and will be useful for our future work."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are ways that Spielman et al could make it easier to reproduce their work, we were able to sufficiently reproduce every relevant output dataset.\n",
    "We find that their results to be legitimate, highlighting issues of internal and theoretical consistency with SoVI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main takeaway from reproducing Spielman et al's work is that merely providing one's code, data, and metadata is insufficient for allowing other researchers to quickly reproduce one's results.\n",
    "In particular, containerizing their software environment, cleaning their code and omitting extraneous information, providing some metadata regarding the structure of their code and data files, and including code for every step of the analysis from data acquisition to figure production would all enhance the reproducibility of their work.\n",
    "Spielman et al produced a well-designed study in a reproducible repository, but a more carefully designed and fully executable research compendium would reduce the risk of transcription errors and allow researchers to reproduce their results in a more reasonable time frame."
