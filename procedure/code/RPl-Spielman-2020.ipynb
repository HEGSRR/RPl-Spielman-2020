    "\n",
    "Spielman et al. (2020) developed methods to evaluate the internal consistency and construct validity of the Cutter, Boruff and Shirley (2003) Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI).\n",
    "First, they reproduce a national SoVI model and validate it against an SPSS procedure provided by the original research group (Hazards Vulnerability Research Institute at University of South Carolina).\n",
    "The original SoVI uses 42 independent z-score normalized variables from the U.S. Census, reduces the data to factors using Principal Components Analysis, selects the first eleven factors, inverts factors with inverse relationships to social vulnerability, and sums the factors together to produce a SoVI score.\n",
    "The reproduced SoVI model was slightly different than the original model due to changes in U.S. Census data, using only 28 variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spielman et al. modify the geographic extent of the SoVI calculation by calculating SoVI on a national extent, and then recalculating for each of ten Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) regions, and again for a single state or cluster of states within each of the ten regions, resulting in 21 total indices.\n",
    "Internal consistency is assessed by calculating the spearman rank correlation coefficient of the SoVI score for counties in the state model compared to the FEMA region model and national model.\n",
    "Construct validity is assessed by summing the loadings for each input variable across the PCA factors in each model and calculating the variables sign (positive/negative) and the rank of the variable's total loading compared to the other variables.\n",
    "These signs and ranks are summarized across all 21 versions of the SoVI model with regard to the number of times the sign is different from the national model and the distributions of ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this replication study, we extend Spielman et al's work by addressing the robustness of SoVI in the temporal dimension. \n",
    "Specifically, we construct a SoVI model using 5-year ACS data published each year between 2012 and 2021, resulting in 10 SoVI models altogether.\n",
    "Using time as our independent variable and z-score standardized SoVI scores as our dependent variable, we assess internal consistency by constructing a linear regression model for every county in our spatial extent.\n",
    "Predicting SoVI score using the year allows us to control for changes in social vulnerability over time.\n",
    "We calculate summary statistics and create a map of standard errors for our regression coefficient in order to interrogate SoVI's robustness oer time.\n",
    "Additionally, similar to Spielman et al., we investigate theoretical consistency by summing the loadings for each input variable across the PCA factors in each model and calculating the variables sign (positive/negative) and the rank of the variable's total loading compared to the other variables.\n",
    "Since we vary time rather than space, we use a rank chart to display our results rather than a table of summary statistics like Spielman et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this Jupyter notebook report is adapted from Spielman et al.'s GitHub repository.\n",
    "The original study states the intended open source permissions in the acknowledgements: \"To facilitate advances to current practice and to allow replication of our results, all of the code and data used in this analysis is open source and available at (https://github.com/geoss/sovi-validity).\n",

    "## Study design\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous work, we computationally reproduced Spielman et al's original paper using the code provided in their Github repository (https://github.com/geoss/sovi-validity).\n",
    "A report on our reproduction is available online (https://osf.io/4s62b), and the code is included in our GitHub repository (https://github.com/HEGSRR/RPl-Spielman-2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "The original paper was a replication study testing the sensitivity of SoVI to changes in geographic extent.\n",
    "Spielman et al addressed the following hypotheses in their work:\n",
    "\n",
    "> OR-H1: SoVI is internally inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this hypothesis, Spielman et al illustrated that SoVI is not robust to changes in geographic extent by calculating SoVI scores for ten selected states or groups of states on three geographic extents: national, FEMA region, and state(s).\n",
    "The counties within the state(s) of interest were then selected and ranked according to their SoVI score.\n",
    "OR-H1 was tested by calculating Spearman's rank correlation between the state and FEMA region models and between the state and national models.\n",
    "\n",
    "> OR-H2: SoVI is theoretically inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this hypothesis, Spielman et al used the same SoVI models as described under OR-H1.\n",
    "For each model, they summed all of the PCA factors together to determine the net influence of each variable in each model.\n",
    "Then they recorded the signs of each variable and calculated the number of deviations of the ten state and FEMA region models from the national model.\n",
    "They also ranked the variables by absolute value for each model and calculated summary statistics regarding the distribution of ranks for each variable amongst all models.\n",
    "Spielman et al did not use a particular statistical method to test OR-H2, but illustrated substantial disagreements between variable rankings and signs amongst the 21 SoVI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our replication, we begin with the same hypotheses as Spielman et al, but we will test those hypotheses by varying the temporal extent rather than spatial extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "> RPl-H1: SoVI is internally inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this hypothesis, we will calculate SoVI scores for the entire nation (excluding Puerto Rico) using 5-year ACS data published each year between 2012 and 2021.\n",
    "In Spielman et al.'s analysis that varies spatial extent, we expect rankings in a given subregion to be identical regardless of the spatial extent, because the attributes in the area and the factors causing vulnerability remain constant.\n",
    "This is no longer true when we vary time, because we expect some areas to become more or less vulnerable over time.\n",
    "Since we do not expect rankings to remain constant, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is no longer an appropriate model for us.\n",
    "Instead, we seek to analyze consistency of SoVI scores while controlling for change over time.\n",
    "To do this, we construct a linear regression model for every county in our spatial extent using time as our independent variable and z-score standardized SoVI scores as our dependent variable.\n",
    "We calculate summary statistics and create a map of standard errors of our regression coefficient in order to interrogate SoVI's robustness over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> RPl-H2: SoVI is theoretically inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this hypothesis, we will use the same SoVI models as described under RPl-H1.\n",
    "Like Spielman et al., we sum all of the PCA components together to determine the net influence of each variable in each model.\n",
    "We conduct an analogous analysis to Spielman et al.'s, calculating each variable's sign (positive/negative) and rank compared to the other variables, but since we address change over time, we present our results in the form of a rank chart rather than a table of summary statistics.\n",
    "Furthermore, rather than ranking the magnitude of coefficients, we split each model into positive and negative coefficients, and rank them separately.\n",
    "This allows us to present information about sign and magnitude of coefficients in the same graph."

    "### Bias and threats to validity\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible threats to validity in this study include spatial dependence and nonstationarity, temporal dependence, and scale dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding spatial dependence and spatial nonstationarity, we expect nearby places to exhibit similar levels of social vulnerability as well as similar underlying causes of it. \n",
    "Although spatially explicit PCA methods have been developed, the methodology used to calculate SoVI uses ordinary PCA, which does nothing to account for spatial relationships.\n",
    "Thus, each county is treated as an independent observation even though there may be spatial clustering of social vulnerability and its underlying factors.\n",
    "To this end, Spielman et al. found substantially different variable weights and rankings of SoVI scores depending on the spatial extent of input data.\n",
    "We do not control for this since our work is also an evaluation of SoVI's consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also anticipate temporal correlation in county SoVI scores, because demographic characteristics change over time and may be more similar in two subsequent years than in two years that are a decade apart. \n",
    "We account for temporal dependence by using year as a variable in linear regression.\n",
    "However, there is temporal dependence not only in social vulnerability but also in the very data we are using for our analysis.\n",
    "Because we use overlapping 5-year averages, four-fifths of the data used to generate each dataset is also used to generate the subsequent and previous year's datasets.\n",
    "The similarity of input data puts us at risk of showing SoVI to be more consistent than it really is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, SoVI is likely scale dependent, as some input demographic variables, like race and ethnicity, show substantially greater variation at the tract level than at the county level.\n",
    "Differing variability depending on scale of analysis may have spillover effects on variance-based models such as PCA.\n",
    "For example, in \"Social vulnerability indices: a comparative assessment using uncertainty and sensitivity analysis\", Eric Tate found that PCA-based social vulnerability models like SoVI exhibit high levels of scale dependency (Tate, 2012)."

    "If SoVI is theoretically consistent, we would anticipate variable rankings and signs to be fairly consistent over time.\n",
    "On our figure, this would be illustrated with few lines crossing each other, few lines crossing the zero line, and narrow ranges of each variable's rankings.\n",
    "The more that variables switch ranks, the more that variables switch signs, and the greater the range of each variable's ranks, the less theoretically consistent SoVI is over time."
